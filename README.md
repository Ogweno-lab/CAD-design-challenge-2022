## CAD-design-challenge-2022


<hr>

This repo contains material for design of a vehicle engine competition for SES projects 2022. Our model is loosely based on the Engine specs of the 2021 MustangGT V8 engine. 

## Instructions

### Team Members
Allan Okeyo
Ogweno Emmanuel
Mandela

### Goals
The teams have to design, draw CAD drawings, perform analysis(stress and vibrations), assemble and animate
the engine. An engine has so many parts and it could be divided into the following 4 categories. Each member can handle one sub-system:
 <br>
 ***Cylinder Sub-System***
1. Cylinder Block
2. Cylinder Head
3. Crank Case

***Piston Sub-System***
1. Piston
2. Piston Ring
3. Connecting Rod
4. Piston Pin

***Crankshaft Sub-System***
1. Crankshaft
2. Flywheels
3. Sprocket Gears
4. Chain Drive

***Cam Shaft Sub-System***
1. Camshaft
2. Engine Valves
3. Manifolds

<br/> <br />
For every sub-system, every part and other necessary parts not mentioned e.g bolts etc, should be modelled
 and analyzed. Also, the whole subsystem assembly should be animated. <br/>
 Once each sub-system is complete, the whole engine, an assembly of assemblies, is assembled and if possible,
 animated as a whole. The teams will have to do research on the engine type they intend e.g boxer, V, VR, W, 
 inline etc. to model and work together to come up with fitting dimension for each part. 
 <br/>
 A good constraint would be to limit the minimum number of cylinders in an engine to 4. The duration of the whole
 challenge will be 6 weeks, with the first week used for research.
 
 ### Documentation and Collaboration
 1. The teams should document their design choices and reasons for the same.
 2. Each team will create a branch on this repo and use it to track their progress.
 3. Finally, each team will share its design and assembly files on GrabCAD and any automation scripts on Github so that others can access them.
